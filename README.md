Still in developement as you can see.

# Compilation & Execution

We don't have any release yet so you can only compile the project by yourself for the moment.

* Download SFML 2.4.2 : https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.4.2/

* Link SFML to your IDE :
  + Windows
    - Visual Studio : https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-vc.php
    - Code Blocks : https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-cb.php
  + Linux : https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-linux.php
  + MacOS (Xcode) : https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-osx.php
  + Compilation with CMake : https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/compile-with-cmake.php
  
* Don't forget to put the .dll files in the right folder. These files are located in $(your SFML directory)/bin

* Make a new project and add our source/header files (located in nenequest/src and nenequest/headers) manually

You can ask for help in issues if you're having some troubles.

# Collaborations

You can also contribute in :
- C++ programming (you don't necessarily have to be experimented but you should be used to programming with at least one imperative language)
- 2D Graphics reproduction
- Maybe more if you have any ideas...
